### Hi there, welcome! ðŸ‘‹

---

I have been working professionally as an iOS Developer since Oct/2019. I write articles about what I am currently learning on my personal [blog](https://vinileal.com) and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@vinciusleal).  

I love being able to deliver a smooth experience for the users. I feel motivated with the challenges of creating beautiful and consistent interfaces in an app.

My goal is to build a solid career as an iOS Developer, write clean and beautiful code.

For the past year, I have been focusing on improving my Swift and Xcode skills to build scalable, maintainable and testable code.

Recently, I was in contact with **Test Driven Development**. I became very interested in this methodology, and have been studying more and more about this.
